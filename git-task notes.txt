Created file: hello_world.js
Code inside: console.log("Hello World!");

Command used:
git status
Result:
Git shows hello_world.js and git-task note(my repporting notes) under Untracked files, meaning Git has noticed the files exists but it is not beingtracked yet(not added to the repo)

After running git add hello_world.js
Command:
git status
Output/Notes:
- hello_world.js is now tracked and staged under changes to be committed
- git-task notes.txt is still untracked under untracked files

Changes to be committed:
  new file: hello_world.js

Untracked files:
  git-task notes.txt

After editing hello_world.js to print "Git is awesome":
git status
Result:
- hello_world.js show under changes to be committed (staged version)
- hello_world.js also shows under changes not staged for commit (modified but not staged)
- git-task notes.txt is still untracked

Command used:
git add hello_world.js
git status
Result:
- hello_world.js is shown under changes to be committed(staged)
- git-task notes.txt is still under untracked files
Changes to be committed:
  new file: hello_world.js

Untracked files:
  git-task notes.txt

I ran:
git commit -m "Add hello_world and update message"

- commit was created successfully
- git status show untracked file: git-task notes.txt, so the repo is clean execpt for that untracked file.
